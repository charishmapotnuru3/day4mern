*what is mutable and immutable in python with example and uses?
-->Mutable:
   -The mutable objects can be changed to any value or state without adding a new object.
   -Mutable objects are  can make changes in-place, without allocating a new object.
   -slower access comapres to immutable objects
   -Examples:List, Sets, and Dictionary
-->Immutable:
   -The immutable objects can not be changed to its value or state once it is created.
   -quicker to access comapres to mutable objects
   -Examples:String,Tuples
   -mmutable objects are inherently thread-safe.
*what is list in python?
-->A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. 
*what are the list methods in python?
-->1.In Python, list objects have several built-in methods that can be used to manipulate and work with lists. Here are some common list methods:
   2. append(x): Add an item to the end of the list.
   3. insert(i, x): Insert an item at a given position.
   4. remove(x): Remove the first occurrence of a value from the list.
   5. pop([i]): Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified, removes and returns the last item in the list.
   6. clear(): Remove all items from the list.
   7. index(x[, start[, end]]): Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is equal to x.
   8. count(x): Return the number of times x appears in the list.
   9. sort: Sort the items of the list in place.
  10.reverse(): Reverse the elements of the list in place.
  11.copy(): Return a shallow copy of the list.
